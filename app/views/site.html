    <h3>About This Site:</h3>
    <p>
      This site originally was built as a set of three very static HTML CSS/JS pages with misc. information about myself.
      It is hosted by github pages using what looks like a varnish http web accelerator and using the default HTTPS encryption.
      Which is a good thing, because I’m getting around an average of 0.6 second load time on some very bad wifi.
      The current iteration of this site is using angular.js and bootstrap, this template was generated using yeoman.
      The yeoman built framework is using grunt as the task runner and some default minimization and compression for the files.
      I’ll be adding a travis CI pipeline build in the future to make building and deploying the site easier.
